# Project1

## Getting started

**First I created the gitLab project, created working-branch from main and invited the professors to review the code.**

**Then I cloned the project on my Desktop, started working on the created branch and then continously pushed the changes. In the end I merged all the changes in main**

```
git clone https://git.brainster.co/Lutmira.Peci-3/project1.git
git pull
git checkout working-branch
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push -u origin working-branch
____________________________

git checkout main
git pull
git merge working-branch
```
